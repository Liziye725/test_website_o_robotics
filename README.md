# React + Vite

We use a template for minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

You can set your environment by:
```
npx create-vite@latest your_folder_name --template react
```


Use `cd` to the folder by:
```
cd your_folder_name
```

Install the packages by:
```
npm install
```
Run on your localhost:
```
npm run dev
```
